1. Create a docker file which builds and create a docker image
2. Use "mvn package" to build the docker
3. create a yaml file for kubernetes which deploys and expose the application via nodeport.
4. Create jenkins job to automate the build and deployment process (YOu may use the jenkins instance from remote machine)
